# <Work-Day-Scheduler>

## Description

This is the mini project 05 for the UT Austin coding boot camp. I was given the index.html and style.css but no script.js for a website that only showed the header. This type of project is called an "on the job ticket" where I was given existing code and the challenge was to write js to make the website work. The challenge for this project was to create a daily schedule that accepts text input form the user. The first thing I did was create a jquery script to display the current date in the header/ Next I created the text block which houses the time blocks, text areas, and save button. I also tied a function to compare the present hour to schedule hour that displays different colors for past, present, and future times. Lastly, the save buttons are tied to local storage to save the text input form the user.

## Usage

This website is designed to show my proficiency in "on the job tickets" and my ability to write jquery code while satisfying the user story and acceptance criteria. This website can be used to store schedule items for the current day, based on user input.The external URL for this daily schedule is:
